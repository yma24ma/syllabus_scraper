# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Syllabus Scraper

### 1. Product Overview

Product Name: Syllabus Scraper (Working Title)

Concept: An automated tool that parses unstructured PDF course syllabi, extracts key deadlines and grade weightings, and exports them into structured formats (Google Calendar, Notion, CSV).

Target Audience: University students (starting with UBC Economics/CS students) who manage 4-5 courses per semester and struggle with manual deadline tracking.

Value Proposition: "Stop manually copying dates. Turn your 10-page syllabus into a schedule in 10 seconds."

### 2. User Stories & Core Features

### Core Features (MVP)

- **PDF Upload:** User can drag and drop a PDF file.
- **Intelligent Parsing:** System identifies:
    - **Event Name:** (e.g., "Midterm 1", "Problem Set 3")
    - **Date & Time:** (e.g., "Oct 15", "11:59 PM")
    - **Weighting:** (e.g., "20%", "150 points")
- **Conflict Detection:** Highlights if a parsed date conflicts with an existing entry (requires calendar integration) or if multiple assignments fall on the same day.
- **Export Options:**
    - `.ics` file (Standard Calendar format for Apple/Google/Outlook).
    - Copy-pasteable table for Notion/Excel.

### User Flow

1. **Landing:** User lands on a clean, minimal homepage.
2. **Upload:** User uploads `ECON_302_Syllabus.pdf`.
3. **Review:** System displays a "Review" table: "I found 5 dates. Please confirm they are correct."
    - *Why this is crucial:* NLP is rarely 100% perfect. The "Human-in-the-loop" review builds trust.
4. **Export:** User clicks "Add to Google Calendar" or "Download .ics".

### 3. Technical Architecture

### Front-End

- **Framework:** **Streamlit** (for fastest MVP) or **React + Tailwind CSS** (for a polished B2C product).
- **Interface:** Minimalist. Focus on drag-and-drop functionality.

### Back-End (The "Brain")

- **Language:** Python.
- **PDF Text Extraction:** `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF` (Fitz). These libraries preserve the physical layout of the text, which is vital for syllabi (e.g., reading tables).
- **NLP / Extraction Logic:**
    - **Regex (Level 1):** Use Regular Expressions to find date patterns (`\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}`, `Sept \d{1,2}`, etc.).
    - **LLM Integration (Level 2 - Recommended):** Send the raw text to the **OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini)** or a lightweight local model.
    - *Prompt Engineering:* "Extract all assignments, exams, and their due dates and weights from the following text. Return JSON format."

### Data Structure (JSON Output Example)

```json
{
  "course_code": "ECON 302",
  "events": [
    {
      "title": "Midterm Exam",
      "date": "2026-02-14",
      "time": "14:00",
      "weight": 0.25,
      "type": "Exam"
    },
    {
      "title": "Problem Set 1",
      "date": "2026-01-20",
      "time": "23:59",
      "weight": 0.05,
      "type": "Assignment"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Economic & Data Science Differentiation

Since you want to leverage your background, here is how you make this "smarter" than a basic script:

**A. The "Grade Value" Calculation (Economics Angle)**

- **Feature:** Calculate the "Opportunity Cost" of missing an assignment.
- **Logic:** If "Assignment 1" is worth 2% and "Midterm" is worth 40%, but they are due on the same day, the UI visually highlights the Midterm as "High Leverage."
- **Formula:** $Leverage Score = \frac{Weight(\%)}{Estimated Effort (hrs)}$.

**B. Workload Distribution (Data Viz)**

- **Feature:** A simple histogram showing "Pressure Points" in the semester.
- **Visualization:** A bar chart where the X-axis is the week number and the Y-axis is the total % of grade due that week.
- **Insight:** "Warning: Week 8 accounts for 35% of your total semester grade."

### 5. Roadmap & Next Steps

**Phase 1: The "Hacker" Version (1-2 Weeks)**

- Build a Python script that runs locally.
- Input: A folder of PDFs.
- Output: A CSV file with dates.
- *Goal: Verify if GPT-4/Regex can actually read messy syllabus formats.*

**Phase 2: The "Wrapper" (2-3 Weeks)**

- Wrap the script in a simple Streamlit app.
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud (Free).
- Share with 5 friends at UBC.

**Phase 3: The "Product" (1 Month)**

- Add Google Calendar API integration (OAuth).
- Add the "Workload Distribution" charts.
- Purchase a domain (e.g., `syllabuddy.com`).
